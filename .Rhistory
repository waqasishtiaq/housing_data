##Run Simple Linear Regression- Price being predicted by Sqft
summary(lm(price ~ sqft))

##The output showed that : price being predicted by sqft. very low-p-value meant high statistical significance. This was supported by the fact that R2= 42.07%

## Run Simple Linear Regression again, now price being predicted by bedroom
Summary(lm(price ~ bedrooms))

## Output showed statistical significanse again. But this time, p-value for bedroom = 0.009, R2= 8.08% b


## Run Linear regression --Price being predicted by BOTH SQFT and BEDROOMS
> summary(lm(price~sqft+bedrooms))

## This time the output showed individual t-test(s)/p-value(s) significant for SQFT while being statistically insignificant for Bedrooms. Thus the final model can only contain the following command.
> Summary(lm(price~sqft))
